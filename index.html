        <p id="who_p">
          I was brought up in the small town of Water Valley, Mississippi.
          Throughout my early education, I did generally well, but I couldn't
          find that one thing I was passionate about, that thing I wished to
          follow for my career path.
          <br />
          <br />
          Enter: Software Development.
          <br />
          Ever since I was shown this field, I've had an insatiable passion for
          it. Every new program is a problem waiting for me to solve, and I
          couldn't be happier than I am when I get my keyboard fixed on a new
          program.
          <br />
          That personal passion and dedication is what I bring to the table
          wherever I go, and it's one of my proudest personal traits.

          As a student of their Graduate Institute, I am also more capable of
          working as leader of or component in a successful development team.
          Thanks to their "leadership teams," I am also comfortable in a variety
          of nonstandard roles and responsibilities as part of life as a
          Developer.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the side of less formal education, I've also spent time studying
          Java, C++, Ruby, Cobol, Assembly, and many other programming
          languages: it's a passion for me, and one I enjoy learning about
          greatly. Beyond programming languages, I also have an understanding of
          system architecture, assembly, networking, and cyber-security.

          Throughout my education, I have pursued several personal projects for
          the purpose of expanding my knowledge, and to establish myself more
          formally. A short list of some of my favorites include:

          <li>
            Created a simulated library with mass data storage and reading
            functionality, including time-stamps on various functions, and the
            ability to "check-out" and "return" books,
